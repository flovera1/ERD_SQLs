# ERD_SQLs
### 1) The firts part of the lab is going to be to build the ERD in MySQL workbench. Then, do reverse engineering and obtain the ERD back to its original form. 45 min
### 2) The second part of the lab is going to be to run the .sql file (Chinook_MySql_insert.sql). This should create the database schema and also populate your database (DB).
### 3) The third part of the lab is to take a look at the DB just created. What did you see in the .sql file? What did you see in your schemas? Then you need to take a look at the file: questions_chinook.txt and try to answer those queries. 59 min.
### 4) Take a look at your queries and compare it with the solutions!
### 5) Get a real tangible example of a real DB (take a look at the ERD diagram - AdventureWorks Entity Relationship Diagram) try to create the DB in MySQL workbench.
